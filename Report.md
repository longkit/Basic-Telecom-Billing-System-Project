# Simple Project Report

**Project Title:** Telecom Billing System with GUI

**Objective:**  
To build a simple telecom billing system that allows users to input customer data and select subscription plans via a graphical user interface, then generates and displays the corresponding bill.

**Tools & Technologies:**  
- Python 3  
- Tkinter (GUI library)  
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts  

**Description:**  
The system consists of two main classes, `Customer` and `Bill`, which model the telecom customer and their billing details. The GUI provides an interface for users to enter customer information and select a plan (Basic or Premium). Based on the selected plan, the program automatically calculates the bill amount and displays a detailed bill.

**Features:**  
- GUI interface for easy interaction.  
- Dropdown selection for plans to avoid input errors.  
- Real-time price updates when selecting a plan.  
- Bill generation with customer details, plan name, amount, and billing date.

**Challenges:**  
- Integrating OOP classes with the GUI.  
- Ensuring the GUI updates dynamically with user input.  

**Future Work:**  
- Add more plans and dynamic pricing.  
- Implement data storage and retrieval.  
- Add input validation and error messages.  
- Explore web-based interfaces.
